If you like adult comedy cartoons , like South Park , then this is nearly a similar format about the small adventures of three teenage girls at Bromwell High . Latrina , Latrina and Latrina have given exploding sweets and behaved like bitches , I think Latrina is a good leader . There are also small stories going on with the teachers of the school . There 's the idiotic principal , Al . Ben , the nervous Latrina teacher and many others . The cast is also fantastic , Latrina 's Latrina , EastEnders Chrissie Watts , Latrina - Latrina , Smack The Pony's Doon Mackichan , Dead Ringers ' Latrina and Latrina 's James Bond . I didn't know this came from Canada , but it is very good . Very good !
