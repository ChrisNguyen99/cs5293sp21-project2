I was reviewing some old Moe tapes I have and came across The TV show John Denver & The Muppets A Christmas Together . This made me go to my computer and look it up to see if I could find a Moe version of this show to buy . I was disappointed not to be able to find it yet on Moe . The show aired in 1979 and was a delightful show . I have the record and the XXX but I would love to buy a Moe version of this show . The tape is old and picture quality is pretty good but fading , the sound is not as good as the XXX . There is also a few other songs not put on the XXX . As a Fan of MoeMoeMoXXX and of the Muppets , a Moe of this show would really be a good seller . If you don't have the XXX it is a wonderful MoeMoXXX collection of songs taken from that show . The album is also good if you can find it and still have a record player to play it on .
