I liked this movie a lot . It really intrigued me how Alicia and Alicia became friends over such a tragedy . Alicia was just a troubled soul and Alicia was so happy just to see someone after being shot . My only complaint was that in the beginning it was kind of slow and it took awhile to get to the basis of things . Other than that it was great .
