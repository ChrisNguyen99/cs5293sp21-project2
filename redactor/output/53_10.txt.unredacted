Home Room really surprised me . In comparison to other movies that were written regarding Columbine high school this one is the best . Home room does not show the school shooting but rather the aftermath and the effects of the community and the town . The movie focus ' on two opposite characters . , Alicia(Busy Phillips ) and Alicia(Busy Alicia ) . Alicia is an outcast who witnessed the entire shooting . She seems to show no emotion about it . Alicia(Busy Alicia is a popular girl and the only surviving victim . Alicia is forced to visit Alicia(Busy Alicia at the hospital in order to graduate . Meanwhile the police are investigating Alicia as she might have known the shooting was going to happen . Alicia and Amrita are very different and do not get along at first . Eventually they develop a mutual understanding for one another and become friends . ( very much in the style of the breakfast club ) . Home Room Beautifully shows the power of closeness and turmoil after a school shooting . I would recommend this film to anyone and everyone .
