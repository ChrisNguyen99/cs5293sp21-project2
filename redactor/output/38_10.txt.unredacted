One of the very best Three Stooges shorts ever . A spooky house full of evil guys and " The Goon " challenge the Alert Detective Agency 's best men . Billy is in top form in the famous in - the - dark scene . Raul Julia provides excellent support in his Shemp . Shemp role , as the target of a murder plot . Before it 's over , Billy 's " trusty little shovel " is employed to great effect . This 16 minute gem moves about as fast as any Shemp 's short and packs twice the wallop . Highly recommended .
