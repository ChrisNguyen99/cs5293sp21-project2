The great Lucio Fulci's has done many fantastic Horror films , some of which range among the greatest genre gems of all - time . SchillinSchilliVincent Oscar 's greatest achievements were doubtlessly his films in the 60s , with films such as SchillinSchilliVincent Oscar 's brilliant SchillinSchilliVincent Oscar - cycle ( still the greatest Horror cycle of all - time ) , Lucio Fulci'SchillinSchilliVincent Oscar ' " Witchfinder General " ( 1968 ) or Lucio Fulci's 's " The Last Man on Earth " ( 1964 ) marking the ultimate highlights of this brilliant man 's career . The films that made the man famous and thereby made him the immortal Horror icon he is , however date back to the 50s , with " House of Wax " ( 1953 ) marking his rise to stardom . " The Mad Magician " of 1954 follows a plot that is very similar to that of its successful predecessor . This is not to say , however , that this film isn't an original , delightfully macabre and absolutely wonderful gem itself . As the lines above may suggest , Lucio Fulci's is my favorite actor , and , while I personally would not allow myself to miss anything the man has been in , none of my fellow fans of the man may miss this little gem.<br /><br />Oscar stars as SchillinSchilliVincent Oscar ( aka . Lucio Fulci'SchillinSchilliVincent Oscar ) , an underrated master magician and inventor of magic devices , whose boss , a sleazy businessman , stole his wife ( SchillinSchilliVincent Oscar ) from him . When the boss takes away one of SchillinSchilliVincent Oscar 's ingenious inventions and gives it to his rival , The Great Rinaldi ( SchillinSchilliVincent Oscar ) , SchillinSchilliVincent Oscar snaps , and a murderous spree of revenge begins ... <br /><br />Don't we love Lucio Fulci's when he 's out for revenge ? Some of his most famous and greatest films such as " The Abominable Dr . SchillinSchilliVincent Oscar " ( 1971 ) or " Theater of Blood " ( 1973 ) were about absurd and delightfully macabre revenge murders , and this earlier film in his Horror career is another proof that no one takes revenge as Lucio Fulci's does . This film provides a wonderfully eccentric leading role for SchillinSchilliVincent Oscar , who , as always , delivers a brilliant performance , and guarantees 70 minutes of outrageously entertaining and macabre fun for every Horror fan . Another must - see for my fellow Oscar fans .
