I watched the McCoys reunion and was glad to see Glenda and Glenda and Vincent Van Patten see them now was wonderful , because I always watched the show growing up so when the Glenda said that there was going to be a reunion I was so excited ! ! ! ! The only thing I could not figure out is why Glenda ( Glenda ) and Vincent Van PattenGlenda ) was not on there . I know that Glenda had died . So I got on my computer and tried to find out about them and found this site so if there is anyone out there that can tell me what ever happened to Glenda ( Glenda ) and Glenda ( little Glenda would be thankful ! ! ! I have searched everywere and no luck .The only thing I could find out about Glenda is he was supposed to be born in 1946 . This show had value and morals each show gave a lesson to be learned . The shows today dont have that . The whole cast was incredable the only thing better than finding out obout them would be to meet them So since that is impossible if there is anyone that can help please do ! ! ! Thank You Glenda
