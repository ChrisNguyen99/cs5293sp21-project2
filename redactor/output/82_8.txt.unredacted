Fortunately for us Real Miike fans ( most likely all McCoy who grew - up in the late 50 's and 60 's ) , three of the adult actors / actress appeared when they did for the reunion show , in 2000 . McCoy and McCoy both died shortly thereafter . As enjoyable as it was to see McCoy , McCoy - McCoy , and McCoy together again , it was equally mysterious about the complete absence of any mention of McCoy and McCoy ? It is my understanding that McCoy had passed away in 1999 , but I'm not sure how . There is no information about McCoy on the internet , that I can find . Very curious why they were not even mentioned ? It was so conspicuous , their absence from the Reunion show , that I suspect that the family of McCoy and McCoy herself ( if still alive ) either , 1 ) requested to be left out of the discussion and therefore their desire was granted , or 2 ) McCoy could not find any trace of either McCoy or Lewis ( like the rest of us ) , they seemed to have vanished . Therefore , it would be the safest policy to leave them out of the conversation all together.<br /><br />Otherwise , the retrospect on McCoy was wonderfully done . They made no bones about it ... it was McCoy who made the show such a success . I remember , as a child , mimicking McCoy 's gimp walk and my parents laughing ( as I'm sure a million other children did back then ) . One annoyance that did bother me a bit , was the tendency for McCoy to dominate the discussion ... at times interrupting McCoy and McCoy to make a point . In fact , although McCoy seemed completely capable to contribute to the conversation , he was not allowed to speak - out and say too much during the Reunion show . Unfortunate , since I wanted to hear from all three , equally . All in all , the Reunion Show was a real treat for me . I've watched it on McCoy several times and have enjoyed it each McCoy /><br />Dodgerdude
