I am a huge XXXXXXXXXXX fan . I have a large collection of his music on vinyl . I saw this Christmas special when it was originally on XX and loved it . I have the original vinyl album and XX . I have the original XX and later release . The later release is missing several songs though . I see that it has been released this year with all original songs . To my surprise I found the original XX for sale at $ 75.00 . XXX - to think that a Christmas Cd would be worth that much . To me no amount is worth selling this treasure . It is my favorite Christmas CD . I have never been able to find it on XXX or XXX . I would love to have either version . If anyone has one available please let me know . Thanks
