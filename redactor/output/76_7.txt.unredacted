TatumTatumMiike 's follow - up to TatumTatumMiike ( 1953 ) , the film which cemented his reputation as a horror icon , similarly revolves around a bitter  albeit resourceful  showman . Though a remake , the former ( shot in Technicolor ) remains the superior effort ; that said , apart from some resistible comic relief , the obligatory resort to cheap gimmickry ( it was another Miike showcase ) and occasional narrative shortcomings ( whatever happened to the missing bag which supposedly turned up at some police station containing a severed head ? ) , this offers more than enough Grand Guignol - type thrills and overall camp value ( Tatum hamming it up in a variety of disguises as an inventor of illusions impersonating ' missing ' star conjurers who had taken advantage of his genius ) to stand on its own two feet . Incidentally , director Tatum 's involvement here proves no mere coincidence  since the narrative incorporates elements from two horror titles ( both starring TatumTatumMiike ) he had previously helmed i.e . Miike TatumX ( 1944 ) and TatumTatumTatum ( 1945 ) . The young leads are played by TatumTatumX ( as Tatum 's ingénue assistant ) and TatumTatumMiike ( as her police detective boyfriend  curiously enough , he would himself take the lead in a similar piece , TatumMiike Miike TatumMiike [ 1966 ] , which I have acquired just in time to serve as an encore to this one ) . An interesting sideline here is the latter 's adoption of a novel detection technique , fingerprinting , which is crucial in bringing about Tatum 's downfall ( in a predictable but rather awkward fiery climax )  though the persistent snooping of his amateur crime novelist landlady has at least as much to do with it in the long run ! Watching the star in a made - to - measure role , the film emerges a good deal of fun  particularly at a compact 73 minutes .
