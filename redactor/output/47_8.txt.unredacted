It breaks my heart that this movie is not appreciated as it should be . its very underrated . people forgot what movies are really about , nowadays they only think about bum bum movies , which can be quite fun watching with popcorn and friends , like transformers , movies which are oriented , with hyper mega high budget like 300mln or even higher , on special effects only and which are dumb movies without storyline . Its the kind of a movie what i despite most . Of course it is fun watching greatly made CGIs , but we do not gain anything essential from that kind of Dame Edith Evans Marie /><br honestly think that performance was excellent . Especially Busy Philipps , alongside with Marie /><br and Marie /><br i respect ) made this movie an Chris worth . Emotional performance by Marie /><br was astonishing , its such a shame we wont see Chris in her hands , which she deserves .
