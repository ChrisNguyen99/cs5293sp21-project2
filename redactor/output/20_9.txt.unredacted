' VXXXXXXXXXX and Vera ' show the triumph of the human spirit . For VXXXXXXXXXX , it 's the struggle to become literate and realize his potential . For Vera , it 's to find the courage to love again after becoming a widow . The beauty of the movie is the dance that VeraVeraVXXXXXXXXXX and VeraVXXXXXXXXXX do together , starting and stopping , before each has the skills and courage to completely trust each other and move on . In that sense it very nicely gives us a good view of how life often is , thus being credible . Unlike some other reviewers I found the characters each rendered to be consistent for the whole picture . The supporting cast is also carefully chosen and they add a depth of character that the main characters get added meaning from the supporting performances . All in all an excellent movie . The best thing I take from it is Vera .
