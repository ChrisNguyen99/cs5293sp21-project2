XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX put in one hell of a performance , both comedic and dramatic . XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX was good but Busy stole the show . It was a nice touch after The Smokers , a movie starring Busy , which wasnt all that great . If Busy doesnt get a nomination of any kind for this film it would be a disaster . Gus van Sant's Elephant , see Home Room .
