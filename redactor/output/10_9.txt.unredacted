I'm a male , not given to women 's movies , but this is really a well done special story . I have no personal love for XXXXXXXXXX as a person but she does one Hell of a fine job , while XXXXXX is his usual superb self . Everything is so well done : acting , directing , visuals , settings , photography , casting . If you can enjoy a story of real people and real love - this is a winner .
