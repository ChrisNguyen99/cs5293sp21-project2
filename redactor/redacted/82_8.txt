Fortunately for us Real McCoy fans ( most likely all XXXXXXXXXXXX who grew - up in the late 50 's and 60 's ) , three of the adult actors / actress appeared when they did for the reunion show , in 2000 . XXXXXXXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXXXXXXXX both died shortly thereafter . As enjoyable as it was to see XXXX , XXXXX - XXXX , and XXXXXX together again , it was equally mysterious about the complete absence of any mention of XXXXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX ? It is my understanding that XXXXXXXXXXX had passed away in 1999 , but I'm not sure how . There is no information about XXXXXX on the internet , that I can find . Very curious why they were not even mentioned ? It was so conspicuous , their absence from the Reunion show , that I suspect that the family of XXXXXXX and XXXXX herself ( if still alive ) either , 1 ) requested to be left out of the discussion and therefore their desire was granted , or 2 ) XXX could not find any trace of either XXXXXXX or Lydia ( like the rest of us ) , they seemed to have vanished . Therefore , it would be the safest policy to leave them out of the conversation all together.<br /><br />Otherwise , the retrospect on XXXXXXXXXXXXXX was wonderfully done . They made no bones about it ... it was XXXXXXX who made the show such a success . I remember , as a child , mimicking XXXXXXX 's gimp walk and my parents laughing ( as I'm sure a million other children did back then ) . One annoyance that did bother me a bit , was the tendency for XXXXXXXXXXXXXX to dominate the discussion ... at times interrupting XXXX and XXXXXXXX to make a point . In fact , although XXXXXXXXXXXXX seemed completely capable to contribute to the conversation , he was not allowed to speak - out and say too much during the Reunion show . Unfortunate , since I wanted to hear from all three , equally . All in all , the Reunion Show was a real treat for me . I've watched it on XXX several times and have enjoyed it each XXXXXXXX /><br />Dodgerdude
