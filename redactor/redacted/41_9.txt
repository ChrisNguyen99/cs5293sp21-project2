" Who Done It? " contains many surefire laughs and gags . It is not only one of the best Stooges films with Shemp , it is one of the finest short comedies Columbia produced . Director Bernds originally wrote the screenplay in 1946 for the Stooges , but when XXXXXXXXXXXX suffered a career - ending stroke , it was tailored for the Columbia comedy team of XXXXXXXXX and XXXX ( their version was released as " Pardon My Terror . " ) It obviously was too good for the Stooges to pass up , and it was finally filmed by the Stooges at the end of 1947.<br /><br />Old XXXXXXXXXXXX calls ace detectives Shemp , XXXXX , and XXX out of fear that he will be murdered . When they arrive at his home , XXXXXXXX has disappeared , and his niece and assorted goons try to get rid of the Stooges . Will they find XXXXXXXX and bring the niece and goons to justice ? < br /><br />Shemp is particularly funny in this film . His reactions after being given a mickey by XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX are superb ; he gives his trademark sound ( eeeb - eeeb - eeeb ) and XXXXXXXXXXXXX is noticeably trying not to laugh ! Other funny scenes : the close - up of XXX 's mug looking through the camera lens ; and the in - the - dark fight with all cast members involved.<br /><br />Nikko the goon ( played by XXXXXXXXX ) is one of the most unusual looking characters ever portrayed in a Stooges film . With his kinked hair , he could almost pass for a XXXXXX , if he didn't tower over everyone else ! " Who Done It? " is a gem among the Stooges films with Shemp . Even die - hard XXXXX fans will enjoy this one ! A true XXXXXX classic . 9 out of 10 .
