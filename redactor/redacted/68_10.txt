Why a stupid , boring , crappy overrated film series like " Star Wars " gets all the hype , and a truly amazing film like this one goes completely un - noticed .. is beyond me ... This movie will really open your eyes to the dark , disturbing , sad , and scary world we live in ... <br /><br />Unlike the boring " Elephant " , this movie isn't one of those " just a typical day until someome pulls the trigger " movies .. this movie focuses more on what happens XXXXX the event ... <br /><br />Deana , played by the very hot and very talented XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX , is a happy and healthy straight - A student with great friends and a great life ... until ... she is injured on the day of the shooting , by being shot in the head .. Luckily she is not killed , but is severely injured and has to be in the hospital for a while , causing her to be in a lot of emotional pain , in addition to the physical ... <br /><br />Meanwhile , XXXXXX , played by the also very gorgeous and talented XXXXXXXXXXXXX , is a nasty , cold - hearted , rebellious , anti - social goth girl who doesn't have a single positive trait on her ... and she is unharmed when the shooting happens .. because it turns out , she was XXXXXXX with the shooter and knew he was going to do what he did ... which causes her to be brought into the police station and be asked some questions .. When she refuses to tell the cops if she knew the shooting was going to happen , they constantly come by her house to try to convince her to say something ... and she still doesn't , so the principal of the school makes her attend a funeral of one of the dead students , and after she walks out on that ... the principal decides enough is enough , and forces her to go visit XXXXX in the hospital .. Of course she refuses this too , but the principal says that if XXXXXX doesn't do this , the cops are going to continue to try to get her to say something .. and so she actually goes to see her ... <br /><br />The lonely , traumatized , and both physically and emotionally wounded XXXXX is more than happy to have someone visit her , but of course , XXXXXX is anything XXX happy to be seeing her .. XXXXX attempts to give her a friendly welcome , but of course , XXXXXX responds with nothing but harsh and hurtful comments and a harsh statement on how she is only here because she is being forced , and has no intention of being friendly with her at all . But sooner or later , that intention will change ... ( and that 's all I'll say :) This is truly one of the most moving movies ever , as well as one of the most dark and disturbing .. Actually , I think I would tie this with " American History X " as equally disturbing and moving at the same time ... <br /><br XXXXXXXXX : Watch this movie at your own risk ! ! It contains XXXX graphic scenes and images ! XXXXXXXXX and criminally under - appreciated movie ! I feel so ashamed that I'm pretty much the only one that knows about it !
