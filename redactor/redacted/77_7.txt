The film begins with XXXXXXXXXXXXX about to begin his performance as a magician . However , mid - way through the very successful show , the police come and shut him down . It seems that his old boss had cheated him out of the tricks XXXXX had created -- even those he made on his own time at home . As a result , XXXXX justifiably kills the evil man . The problem is that while the viewer understood why XXXXX killed and most probably thought this was a XXXX thing , because XXXXX was a bit mad , he just couldn't stop at one ( sort of like eating XXX 's Potato Chips).<br /><br />The film was full of very creative and spectacular magic tricks ( including a huge circular saw and a crematorium for the shows ) , great plot twists as well as exciting action . One thing you can't say about this film is that it is dull . While it 's also far from subtle , it is fun throughout , though and well worth a look.<br /><br />Had I never seen XXXXXXXXXXXXX 's version of XXXXXXXXXXXX , I probably would have liked XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX a lot more and scored it an 8 or 9 . That 's because while XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX is a wonderful film , it 's highly reminiscent of the film that preceded it ( XXXXXXXXXXXX ) . The bottom line is that since XXXXXXXXXXXX was so successful , the formula was re - hashed in the follow - up film . Both were made in XXX , both have a plot where XXXXX has every justification to kill but he can't stop once he 's committed the first and both are great fun to watch . The biggest differences , and there are few , are that XXXXXXXXXXXX was in color and was more of a horror film and XXX XXXXXXXXXXXX was definitely more of a mystery.<br /><br />My advice is to see this film XXX XXXXXXXXXXXX ( the Price version only ) . They are both terrific 1950s horror films .
