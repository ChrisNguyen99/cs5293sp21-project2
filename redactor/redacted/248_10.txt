' XXXXXXXXX ' is a wonderfully made Australian film honouring a true Australian hero . We are taken into the world of XXX , his best friend , XXXXXXXXX , and the other members of the XXXXXXXXXX , as the film explains and perhaps justifies Ned's actions.<br /><br />There is an exceptional cast present , who all give stellar performances , which brings the film to life . ( Great job , Heath! ) XXXXXXXXXXXXX was fantastic as XXX , playing the role of quiet , loyal ladiesman very well . I was swept up in the moment . For a moment I almost believed the Gang would win the battle at Glenrowan , alas , it was not to be.<br /><br />Some aspects of the film are fictional , and as an avid XXXXXXXXX fan ( and supporter ) , was slightly disappointed by this . Perhaps also the film could've gone longer , to cover more of the Kelly Gang's / Ned's life - I felt not enough was covered.<br /><br />Regardless of a few flaws , this is a moving film , which stirs all sorts of emotions . ( And hey , I'd assume this film would be better to watch rather than XXXXXXXXXXX trying to portray XXX ... )
