I originally watched 8 simple rules on the Disney channel XX for the first series and got completely hooked . When they didn't show it any more \ was annoyed , but then abc 1 satred showing the 2nd series . i didn't think another series would start after I read XXXX ritter had died , however the 2nd series wasn't amazing the latest series is back to it 's old excellent standard . i hope they go on to produce more shows soon even though i could watch each show a thousand times . XXXXX couco is my favourite character as airhead XXXXXXX and also performs amazing in Charmed . XXXX is also good , he shares my name and XXXXXX as well . I'll keep on watching it until it ends until then I hope it carries on as funny as ever
