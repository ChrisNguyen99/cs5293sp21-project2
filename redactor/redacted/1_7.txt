If you like adult comedy cartoons , like South Park , then this is nearly a similar format about the small adventures of three teenage girls at Bromwell High . XXXXXX , XXXXXXX and Latrina have given exploding sweets and behaved like bitches , I think XXXXXX is a good leader . There are also small stories going on with the teachers of the school . There 's the idiotic principal , Mr . Bip , the nervous XXXXX teacher and many others . The cast is also fantastic , XXXXXXXXXXX 's XXXXXXXXXXXX , EastEnders Chrissie Watts , XXXXX - XXXXXXXXXXX , Smack The Pony's Doon Mackichan , Dead Ringers ' XXXXXXXXXX and XXXXXXX 's Nina Conti . I didn't know this came from Canada , but it is very good . Very good !
