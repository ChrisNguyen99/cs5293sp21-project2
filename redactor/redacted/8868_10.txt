I have to say that XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX is one of the top 3 movies I have ever watched . It has a brilliant cast , and an equally brilliant director . XXXXXXXXX shows how life in University can be . There are 3 main story lines , the skinheads , the African - Americans , and the homosexuals . I was intrigued by all of the stories , but the one that got to me the most was the storyline about XXXXXXX , battling her feelings towards another girl . The end was great . After seeing the movie 25 times plus , I still cry . I would have given this movie an 11 , but I have to settlefor 10/10 .
