this was a favorite Christmas Special that I wish that they would release on vhs or dvd , since my 33 XXX got lost , and any cassettes I made are also long gone.<br /><br XXX am not even a big XXXXXXXXXXX fan but was very impressed with the music , which was mostly traditional favorites with a muppet spin ( esp Little St . Nick ! ) It also contained a few little known songs ( original ? ) .<br /><br />Even though it was done at the end of the ' 70 's this show had a timeless feel to it . Hoping to find a copy soon ! ! !
