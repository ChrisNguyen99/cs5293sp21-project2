I loved The Real Mc Coys ( 1957 - 1963 ) It is too bad that XXXXXXXXXX has decided to be forgotten and not appear . She was excellent in the show . Of course XXXXXXXXXXXXXX was great as well as XXXXXXXXXXXXX . I loved it when he called XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX . I have purchased XXXXXXXX on XXX and I cannot wait to buy Seasons 2 - 6.If only there would be more shows on television like this one , everything would be better . This show appeared briefly in the summer of 1999 but then disappeared . God bless all the departed members of the cast and please , XXXXXXXXXXX , make yourself known again to the public . You are loved and respected . The Real Mc Coys will live forever .
