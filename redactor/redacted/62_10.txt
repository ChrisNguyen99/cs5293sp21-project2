I absolutely loved this movie . I bought it as soon as I could find a copy of it . This movie had so much emotion , and felt so real , I could really sympathize with the characters . Every time I watch it , the ending makes me cry . I can really identify with XXXXXXXXXXXX 's character , and how I would feel if the same thing had happened to me.<br /><br XXX think that all high schools should show this movie , maybe it will keep people from wanting to do the same thing . I recommend this movie to everybody and anybody . Especially those who have been affected by any school shooting.<br /><br />It truly is one of the greatest movies of all time .
