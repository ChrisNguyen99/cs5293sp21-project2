I was reviewing some old XXX tapes I have and came across The TV show John Denver & The Muppets A Christmas Together . This made me go to my computer and look it up to see if I could find a XXX version of this show to buy . I was disappointed not to be able to find it yet on XXX . The show aired in 1979 and was a delightful show . I have the record and the XX but I would love to buy a XXX version of this show . The tape is old and picture quality is pretty good but fading , the sound is not as good as the XX . There is also a few other songs not put on the XX . As a Fan of XXXXXXXXXXX and of the Muppets , a XXX of this show would really be a good seller . If you don't have the XX it is a wonderful XXXXXXXX collection of songs taken from that show . The album is also good if you can find it and still have a record player to play it on .
