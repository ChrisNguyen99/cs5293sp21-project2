This is no art - house film , it 's mainstream entertainment . < br /><br />Lot 's of beautiful people , t&a , and action . I found it very entertaining . It 's not supposed to be intellectually stimulating , it 's a fun film to watch ! XXXXX and XXXXX are funny too , which is just gravy . Definitely worth a XXXXXXXXXX /><br />So in summary , I'd recommend checking it out for a little Friday night entertainment with the boys or even your girl ( if she likes to see other girls get it on!)<br /><br />The villains are good too . Vinnie , XXXXXXXXXXX , the hatian guy from Heroes . Very nasty villains .
