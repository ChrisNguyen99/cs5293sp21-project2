' One - Round ' XXXXXXXXXXX is called that because he 's a carnival boxer who fights any man in the audience . If they can last one round , they win a prize -- a popular way to draw customers into traveling shows long ago . XXXX is in love with the ticket girl , XXXXX , though her head is quickly turned when XXXXXXXXX enters the ring to try his chances with XXXX . What no one at the fight knows is that XXX is the champ , so he 's able to beat XXXX -- though it takes him some work . As a result , XXX asks XXXX to become his sparring partner and give up the carnival circuit . Later , XXXX improves so much that he , too , becomes a legitimate boxer . XXXXXX , he works his way up the rankings until he 's nearly ready to take on the Champ.<br /><br />In the meantime , the XXXXX and XXXXX start running around behind XXXX 's back -- even though by now XXXXX has married XXXX . So , when the final fight occurs between XXXX and XXX , it 's very personal and XXXX is ready to kill him . Is he good enough ? Will rise justifiable rage against XXX help or hinder his performance ? Tune in and see.<br /><br />This film was directed by XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX and while today this sort of film seems strange for a director known for mystery - suspense films , back in the 1920s , XXXXXXXXX had no fixed genre which he directed or wrote ( he did both for this film ) . In fact , in many ways this film is more indicative of XXXXXXXXX 's silent style , as a somewhat similar plot came up in one of his next silents , XXX XXXXXXX ( also starring XXXXXXXXXXXX as the wronged husband ) . So , while this seems a lot like a standard boxing film of the day , it was not a radical departure for this great director -- even with its rather formulaic ending.<br /><br />Overall , while a bit predictable and having XXXXXXXXXX playing a boxing champ seems silly , the film works well . While far from a perfect silent , it 's well worth seeing and packs a nice punch .
