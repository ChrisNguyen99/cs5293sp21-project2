A few years ago I added a comment to the XXXX on " The Real McCoys " XX series . I said then and repeat now it was a charming , funny , and entertaining show , well - acted with wonderful XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX /><br XXX recently saw on XXX four old episodes XXXX the Reunion of 2000 with XXXXXXXXXXXXXX , XXXXXXXXXXX , and XXXXXXXXXXXXX . As another writer here mentioned , it is curious that XXXXXXXXXX ( XXXXXX ) and XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX ( XXXXXXXXXXX ) weren't refered to , but perhaps they can be tracked down via XXX or AFTRA.<br /><br />The reunion show was well done and gave us many unknown insights into the show . One piece of inside information we did XXX get was whether or not XXXXXXXXXXX regretted quitting the show in an unpleasant contract dispute , which left XXXX a " widow " in it 's last year , which wasn't very good . XXXXX went on to do a bomb of a comedy called " Broadside " , about women nurses in the Pacific in XXXXX . Get it ? BROADside ? No , not XXXXXXXXX /><br />Unlike the sleazy , salacious , and violent XXXXX on XX now that is so undermining our values , " The Real McCoys " entertained with decent values and fine human beings . And I thank all involved , including the creator , XXXXXXXXXXXXX , for having brought it to my family . We never missed it .
